### üîó Data Source & Integration
The dataset was originally sourced from **Kaggle**.  
To automate the process, a small **Python script** was written to fetch the dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API and save it into a local folder.  
Power BI was then connected to this folder, ensuring that any new data fetched by the Python script could be seamlessly updated in the dashboard.

This integration provided:
- **Automation:** Eliminated manual downloading of files  
- **Reproducibility:** Same script can fetch updated data anytime  
- **Scalability:** Easy to extend for multiple datasets
